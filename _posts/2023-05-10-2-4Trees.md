## 2-4Trees?

- 2-4Trees are subtype of tree called **B-Trees**.
  - B-Trees allow the number of data and children to vary in a node or a block.
- 2-4Trees aim to guarantee O(log N) operations by maintaining some sort of balancing schema.

- 2-4 Trees enforce a more strict shape property than any of the trees.

  - Every leaf node must reside on the same level(=Every depths are same.)

- Order property requires that the data stored in a node is done so in ascending order.
  `d1 < d2 < d3`

This order property also extends to the children.
`c1 < d1 < c2 < d2 < c3 < d3 < c4`
