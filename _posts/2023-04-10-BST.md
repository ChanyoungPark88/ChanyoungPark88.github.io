## Data Structure Review
- ArrayList: 
- Singly-Linked List w/ Tail:
- Doublely-Linked List w/ Tail: 

## Trees?

- A trees are **linked structures** that are connected and do not have cycles.
- Can be implemented in multiple ways depending on the details of the type of tree.
- Trees can be further categorized if we give them some other properties:
    **Shape**: What is the structure of the node in the tree?
    **Order**: How is the data arranged in the tree?

## Binary Trees

Binary Trees are defined by three properties.
1. Every node can have at most two children.
2. Child nodes are labeled left and right child.
3. Left child always precedes the right in the order of the nodes, not the data.

Binary Trees have three shape properties.
1. Full Tree: Each node must have 0 or 2 children.
2. Complete Tree: Every level must be filled except for the last one, which is filled left to right.
3. Degenerate Tree: All nodes have 1 child.

## Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Trees are a type of Binary tree that inherit all the properties from Binary Trees and **enforce a data order property** where left child data is less than parent data which is less than the right child data.
