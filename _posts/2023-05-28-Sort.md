## Sorting

- **Arranging** data based on defined **order**
- **Order** is established based on **comparisons**

## Types of Sorting Algorithms

- Iterative Sorting Algorithms
    - Iterate through the data several times to sort using comparisons.
    - e.g., Bubble Sort, Cocktail Shaker Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort

- Divide & Conquer Sorting Algorithms
    - Tear the data down into subsets and sorts the subsets using comparisons
    - e.g., Merge Sort, In-place Quicksort
