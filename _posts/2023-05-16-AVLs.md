## AVL trees

AVL Trees are sub classification of BSTs.

## AVL Properties and Efficiency

- **Height(node)** = max{Height(left), Height(right)} + 1

  - Base cases: Height(leaf) = 0, Height(null) = -1

- **BalanceFactor(node)** = Height(left) - Height(right)

- AVLs store heights and balance factors to make calculations O(1) as opposed to O(n)

## Definition of Unbalanced

- Node is unbalanced if `|BF| > 1`
- Node is balanced if `BF = -1, 0, 1`

## Rotaions

**Rotations** are operations performed in AVL trees to maintain and restore balance.

In AVL trees, there are two fundamental types of rotations.

- Single rotation:
- Double rotation:
